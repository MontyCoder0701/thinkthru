# Thinkthru

An application for mindful thinking, for those with impulsive thinking mechanisms.  
Based on my previous application, BetterChoices.

## Features
### Thoughts
- Record your thoughts, with their own pros and cons
- Record how many times you thought this through before you move on to actual actions

### Rules
- Record your rules, so you have a clearly set up path of thinking
- These rules will help you make small promises and consistent patterns

### Security
- Make sure your sensitive and secretive thoughts aren't easily exposed to others
- This application does NOT store your personal data where anyone can access. It is all stored in the local database in your own phone.
- This also means that if you delete your app, recovery of data is IMPOSSIBLE.
- I do not intend to change this in the future.
